### Summary and goals
Build a small, usable framework of my own, to both highlight my knowledge and understanding and streamline potental work.

### Classes

There are four types of button. Red, blue, green and 'cancel'. The ```btn``` class will have you starting a button. ```btn-red```, ```btn-green```, ```btn-blue``` and "```btn-back``` will change the layout. The ```click``` class adds a clicking effect.
