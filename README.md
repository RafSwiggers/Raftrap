### Summary and goals
Build a small, usable framework of my own, to both highlight my knowledge and understanding and streamline potental work.

### Classes
#### Buttons
There are four types of button. Red, blue, green and 'cancel'. The ```btn``` class will have you starting a button. ```btn-red```, ```btn-green```, ```btn-blue``` and "```btn-cancel``` will change the layout. The ```click``` class adds a clicking effect.

##### Green
Green background color, white lettering.

##### Blue
Egyptian blue background, white lettering.

##### Cancel
White background, blue border, blue lettering

##### Red
Red background, white lettering.

##### Click
Adds a box-shadow on hover, that dissapears when you click.

#### Grid
Divides your container into a 10X10 grid, fitting to size. For easy layout and reference

#### Code
Black background, green lettering. Specific matrix-like font. No specificity for different languages.

#### Bruce
The Bruce class turns your div into a banner. Page-wide, blue, gradient background. 

#### Title
A miniature version of the Bruce class.

#### Navbar
Styles a UL into a vertical, side-lying navbar.

#### Quotestrap
I made two distinct versions of a quote class. This gives you the choice between a light version and a dark version.

##### Quotestrapwhite
This will put the quote center page, new font, square border of half-page width. All in white.

##### Quotestrapblack
This will put the quote center page, new font, square border of half-page width. All in black.
